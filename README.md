# Movie Review Aggregate

This is my first basic project. Its a single page movie search site that aggregates reviews from Rotten Tomato's, IMDB, and Metacritic. Averages their scores and also providing links and basic information.
I used the OMDB API for the movie search information. The goal was to get a bit more comfortable with Stimulus JS, use an API and practice with the front end.

# Challenges
- Setting the project up from scratch, I used the stimulus starter to assist with this.
- Originally wanted to scrape for some more data on rotten tomatoes (audience score etc.) but found it difficult to get the exact movie page with the data from the API. Larger titles were ok but more obscure movies would unreliably link to another movie or not show.
- Hosting the site, I used heroku linking to a git repository for this

# What I have learned
- More familiar with app set up and packages
- More practice with git branching and merging
- Practice with bootstrap
- More familiar with Stimulus JS and JavaScript

# What I think I can work on
- Better structuring of files and folders
- Having multiple controllers
- Better naming of CSS elements
- Cleaner code in general and being more DRY
